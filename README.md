# 📐 Geometry Area and Volume Calculator

This is a C program that calculates and displays the **area** and **volume** of various 2D and 3D geometric shapes. It also prints ASCII representations for most shapes.

## 🧮 Features

- 📏 **2D Shapes:**
  - Square
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle (Heron’s formula)
  - Parallelogram
  - Trapezium
  - Circle
  - Regular Polygon

- 🧊 **3D Shapes:**
  - Cylinder
  - Cone
  - Sphere
  - Cube/Cuboid
  - Square Pyramid

- ⭐ ASCII art output for basic visual representation

## 📋 Sample Output

```
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME OF AREA VOLUME CALCULATION OF DIFFERENT SHAPES

Which shape would you like to learn about ?
Press the appropriate number:
1.Square
2.Rectangle
...
12.Square pyramid
```

You will then be prompted to enter dimensions for the selected shape. The program calculates the area/volume and displays a simple ASCII sketch of the shape.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Make sure your inputs form a valid geometric figure (e.g., triangle sides must satisfy the triangle inequality).
- This is a beginner-friendly project and does not include input validation or error handling.

## 📚 Concepts Used

- Standard I/O in C (`scanf`, `printf`)
- Geometry formulas
- ASCII graphics using nested loops
- Conditional logic (`switch-case`)
- `math.h` library for square roots and trigonometric functions
